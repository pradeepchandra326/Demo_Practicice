18:30 Local Time, 08:30 GMT, 14:00 IST: Here is the decisive blow from Kaushik Rangarajan - The match has been called off. Pretty inevitable really once the rain set in during the Pakistan v Afghanistan game. So India and New Zealand left with just one game of practice before their tournament proper. Hope the weather clears up for the big clash on Sunday between India and Pakistan. It's not looking great for that game either in Melbourne. Time for us to say ta, ta, bye bye for now. As I say always - read up on all the content here as our correspondents in Australia - Kaushik and Ganesh fire them away at will. Till next time, take care and be well.
18:21 Local Time, 08:21 GMT, 13:51 IST: More bad news from Kaushik Rangarajan in Brisbane: Not sure if you can see it on TV. Umpire Reiffel has just stepped on to the field with a groundsman. It's still pelting down heavily and has been doing for more than 2 hours now. Unlikely we'll get a game even though there is time still. Rain unrelenting."
